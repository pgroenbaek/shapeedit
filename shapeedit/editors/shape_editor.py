class ShapeEditor:
    """
    Wrapper for safely editing the `Shape` data structure.

    The `ShapeEditor` class provides a high-level interface to safely edit
    the internal data of a `Shape` instance while maintaining the
    consistency and invariants required for the shape to remain
    valid and usable in Microsoft Train Simulator (MSTS) and
    Open Rails. It exposes operations such as accessing vertices,
    triangles, points, UV points and normals. It also allows you to
    modify, remove and add new geometry in an existing shape.

    Example:
        >>> import shapeio
        >>> from shapeedit import ShapeEditor
        >>>
        >>> my_shape = shapeio.load("./path/to/example.s")
        >>>
        >>> shape_editor = ShapeEditor(my_shape)
        >>> sub_object = shape_editor.lod_control(0).distance_level(200).sub_object(0)
        >>>
        >>> # Set point values of all vertices in the subobject.
        >>> for vertex in sub_object.vertices():
        ...     vertex.point.x = 0.0
        ...     vertex.point.y = 1.0
        ...     vertex.point.z = 2.0
        >>>
        >>> shapeio.dump(my_shape, "./path/to/output.s")
